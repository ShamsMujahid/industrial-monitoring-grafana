# Electrolyser Core Model Equations

## Reversible Voltage
The reversible cell voltage is derived from thermodynamic principles,
relating Gibbs free energy of water splitting to the minimum required
electrical voltage. A linearized temperature-dependent formulation is used:

E_rev(T) = E0 + alpha (T - T0)

## Ohmic Loss
Ohmic voltage losses are modeled as:

eta_ohm = I · R(T)

with a temperature-dependent resistance:

R(T) = R0(t) · exp(beta (T - T0))

## Aging Model
Resistance degradation is represented by a current-dependent aging state:

dR0/dt = k_deg · |I|

This formulation enables simulation of cumulative aging effects under
dynamic load profiles.
